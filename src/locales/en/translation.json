      "Hi! I am a self-taught frontend developer based in Barcelona, although my journey started far from code... As an architect, I worked for several years turning concepts into reality through design and 3D modeling. In 2021, I discovered web development and was drawn to the possibility to blend my background in design with the precision of code to create interactive digital experiences.",
      "After two years of learning and hands-on practice, I took on my first project as a frontend developer this year. Specialized in React, I focus on building responsive, user-friendly interfaces that required both technical precision and creative problem-solving. Transitioning from architecture to web development has been an exciting challenge for me, allowing me to explore new and rewarding ways to apply my creative and technical problem-solving skills."
